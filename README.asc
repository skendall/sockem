Introduction
------------

Sockem is a Scala DSL/library that provides mechanisms to create and manipulate network graphs.  The
library is intended to provide an API to generate vertices, edges, and the graph itself based on a
simple language notation, as well as allow for multiple types of graph algorithm calculations (i.e.
shortest-path first, traveling salesman problems, path finding, etc).

Additionally, a webservice interface provides a way to create graphs based on calls to a REST API.

Quick start
-----------

1. Add these lines to your build.sbt.

[source]
--
resolvers += "kndl" at "http://mvn.kndl.org/maven2"

resolvers ++= Seq("snapshots", "releases").map(Resolver.sonatypeRepo)

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "org.kndl" %% "sockem" % "0.3"
)
--

2. Example usage below:

[source]
--
 // create a graph
 val g = G("graph")
 // create 3 vertices and add 2 edges between vertex1 and vertex2 and vertex1 and vertex3 with weights 5
 g ++ V("vertex1") ++ V("vertex2") ++ V("vertex3") +| ("vertex1", "vertex2", 5) +| ("vertex1","vertex3",5)
 // visits all vertices in the graph and applies "value" to "key"
 g.visitAll(g) { vertex => vertex.set("key","value") }
 // traverses the shortest path of nodes from start to end
 val (distance,path) = g.traverseShortestPath(V("vertex1"),V("vertex2"))
