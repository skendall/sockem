Introduction
------------

Sockem is a Scala DSL/library that provides mechanisms to create and manipulate network graphs.  The
library is intended to provide an API to generate vertices, edges, and the graph itself based on a
simple language notation, as well as allow for multiple types of graph algorithm calculations (i.e.
shortest-path first, traveling salesman problems, path finding, etc).

Additionally, a webservice interface provides a way to create graphs based on calls to a REST API.
